                    We wanted to focus on empowering local businesses and small
                    mom-pop restaurants in rural areas, starting with the town of
                    Lewisburg. Our objective was to enhance the existing POS
                    system offered by the company and contribute to the vibrant
                    culture of community development and upbringing prevalent in
                    United States.

                    Recognizing the challenges faced by these businesses due to the
                    limited availability or inefficiency of popular apps like Doordash
                    and Grubhub in rural areas, my goal was to create a user-
                    friendly and adaptable online ordering experience for both
                    businesses and customers, ensuring a seamless process.
